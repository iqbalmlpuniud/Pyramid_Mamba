## ðŸ”— Based on Prior Work

This project is **based on** the repository [MambaAD](https://github.com/lewandofskee/MambaAD) by [lewandofskee](https://github.com/lewandofskee), which implements an anomaly detection method using Mamba architecture.

We adapted and extended their codebase to propose a novel architecture named **Pyramid Mamba**, as described in our paper.
